# Dictionary
Dictionary website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with an external API integration to fetch word meanings. Our goal is to create a user-friendly and responsive website that allows users to easily search for the meanings of words. In addition, we will also discuss the implementation of a suggestion feature which suggests the closest word to the given word using the edit distance algorithm, in case the API fails to fetch the meaning of a given word.

# Requirements
Before starting the project, we need to define the requirements of the website. Our dictionary website should have the following features:

# Search Bar
A search bar that allows users to input a word they want to look up in the dictionary. The search bar should be prominently displayed on the homepage to make it easy for users to find.

# List of Matching Words and Their Meanings
After the user enters a word in the search bar, the website should display a list of matching words and their meanings. The list should be easy to read, and the meanings should be concise and accurate.

# External API Integration
The website should be integrated with an external API that fetches word meanings from a large database. This will ensure that the dictionary is more comprehensive and has a larger database of words.

# Suggestion Feature
If the external API fails to fetch the meaning of a given word, the website should have a suggestion feature that suggests the closest word to the given word using the edit distance algorithm. This feature will ensure that users can easily find the meaning of a word even if it is not in the dictionary database.


# Responsive Design
The website should have a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices. This feature will ensure that the website is accessible to users on different devices and will improve the user experience.

# Visually Appealing Design
The website should have a visually appealing design with a consistent color scheme and font. This feature will improve the user experience and make the website more engaging.

# Implementation
To implement the above requirements, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with an external API integration. HTML will be used to create the structure of the website, CSS will be used to style the website, and JavaScript will be used to handle user interactions, dynamic content, and API integration.
